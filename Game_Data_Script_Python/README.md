# Shabd Sharda Game Creation Script

This is the Python Script for creating a New Game data based on the initial letters array provided for the game.

All the possible valid words are found from the game array using the Trie Data Structure which optimally gives back the array of valid words that can be formed from the given array.

The Project uses words_alpha.txt as the english dictionary, know more about the dictionary repo: [https://github.com/dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

## About

#### This is a Word Search Game inspired from Wordament (A game I have been passively playing from years. Based on [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) )

<b>[Shabd (शब्द)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabda)</b> is a Sanskrit word for <b>Word</b> (Speech Sound)<br>
<b>[Sharda (शारदा)]</b> is a Sanskrit word for <b>[Goddess Saraswati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati)</b> (Hindu Goddess of Wisdom)

<p>During the recent Wordle hype, getting reconnected to love for the word games again, I thought of creating a game of myself. <br>[TODO: abhi kuch dimag me nhi a rha, baad me update karunga vro]</p>

-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

### We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/KartikWatts/shabd-sharda/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/KartikWatts/shabd-sharda/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
